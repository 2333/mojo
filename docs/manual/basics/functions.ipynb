    "- Arguments don't require a type specifier. By default, all arguments are\n",

    "  represent most (eventually all) types in the Mojo standard library. For\n",
    "  example, the above `greet()` function can receive a string, an integer, a\n",
    "  list, and other types in the `name` argument. It's the function's\n",
    "  responsibility to detect the types it does or doesn't support.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return types don't need to be declared either, so the function can return\n",
    "  anything (or nothing).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arguments passed into a `def` function are **mutable** variables, using\n",
    "  **value semantics** (by default). This means a `def` function receives a copy\n",
    "  of the argument data, so it can modify arguments inside the function and those\n",
    "  changes are visible only inside the function (unless it returns the values).\n",
    "  (You can instead make arguments immutable, or mutable with reference\n",
    "  semantics, but that's a topic covered in [value\n",
    "  ownership](/mojo/manual/values/).)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability for `def` functions to use undeclared argument types and return\n",
    "types provides simplicity when coding, and flexibility to handle different data\n",
    "types with one function. However, this lack of type enforcement can lead to\n",
    "runtime errors when a function receives or returns an unexpected type. It also\n",
    "adds a runtime performance cost because Mojo must discover the data type at\n",
    "runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can optionally declare types for some or all arguments and return\n",
    "values in a `def` function, and Mojo enforces them at compile time. (See\n",
    "the next section for the type declaration syntax.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you know Python well, it's important to recognize that Mojo's\n",
    "value semantics in a `def` function (passing arguments by value) is a\n",
    "significant divergence from Python. In Python, it only _appears_ that arguments\n",
    "are passed by value. The only arguments that Python actually passes by value\n",
    "are immutable types, such as integers and strings. Python passes all mutable\n",
    "types as object pointers (also called \"pass by assignment\" because it assigns\n",
    "the object pointer to the argument name). If the function assigns a new value\n",
    "to the argument variable, it behaves like value semantics, because the variable\n",
    "now points to a different object. However, if instead of reassigning the\n",
    "variable, you modify the object's value, then Python behaves like reference\n",
    "semantics. For example, if your Python function receives a list and then calls\n",
    "`.append()` on that list, this actually modifies the original object. In Mojo,\n",
    "that won't happen because the `def` function receives its own copy of the list\n",
